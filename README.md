## User Story: 

AS A person interested in national parks and historic sites<br>
I WANT to access a polished mobile-first UI to easily search for historic sites and/or national parks either by location, or by name.<br>
SO THAT I can view information such as fees, activities, description, and designation - and view my last 5 saved searches.<br>

GIVEN I am using the National Park Finder to search for sites<br>
WHEN I open the site<br>
THEN I am presented with a map with pre-loaded plot points of 466 historic parks and sites<br>
WHEN I click on a plot point<br>
THEN I am presented with a button 'View More'<br>
WHEN I click 'View More'<br> 
THEN the site is populated with the following fields:<br>
    --Name<br>
    --City, State<br>
    --Designation<br>
    --Description<br>
    --Entrance Fee<br>
    --Activites<br>
    -- + an image of the park

WHEN I search by specific park name by using the search bar<br>
THEN I am presented with a drop down auto-complete list of potential sites<br>
WHEN I click on a site<br>
THEN the site is populated with the following fields:<br>
    --Name<br>
    --City, State<br>
    --Designation<br>
    --Description<br>
    --Entrance Fee<br>
    --Activites<br>
    -- + an image of the park

WHEN I scroll to the end of the page<br>
THEN I am presented with my last 5 searches in clickable buttons<br>
WHEN I click the previously searched button displaying park name<br>
THEN the site is populated with the following fields:<br>
    --Name<br>
    --City, State<br>
    --Designation<br>
    --Description<br>
    --Entrance Fee<br>
    --Activites<br>
    -- + an image of the park
